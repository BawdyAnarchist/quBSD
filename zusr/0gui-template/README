################  DESCRIPTION  OF  0gui-template  IMPLEMENTATION  ################

rw is used for customizing individual system files (like rc.conf)
   - quBSD symlinks these files during appjail start, replacing rootjail clones 
   - Directory/filename in rw, must map exactly the same as the file it replaces
   - rw nullfs mounts on the appjail's root. For example: /jails/{appjail}/rw/ 

usr/home/0gui-template is the home directory 
   - Jails come with only a single user, with the same name as the jail
	  - To add users, copy from /jails/0gui/etc/ to /zusr/<jailname>/rw/etc/ ...
	      group master.passwd passwd pwd.db spwd.db
       - Then use pw redirection to operate on these files:
           pw -V /zusr/<jailname>/rw/etc  useradd|groupad
   - Recommend personalizing the general setup you want for other GUI jails
       .cshrc
       .vim/ and .vimrc
       .config/falkon/profiles/default/settings.ini
   - You can use 0gui-template for new GUI jails, with the following command:
       qb-create -T 0gui-template -H mynewjail

Default nullfs mounts are already in the fstab, but if you wish to change them:
   - Edit rw/etc/fstab, to change mounts applied during appjail creation 

**Note About Privacy:**  If you create a persistent .mozilla/firefox profile in 0gui-template; it likely comes with fingerpriting risks between your various jails. Create profile in each jail.
