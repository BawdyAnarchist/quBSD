################  DESCRIPTION  OF  0net-template  IMPLEMENTATION  ################

rw is used for customizing individual system files (like rc.conf, or pf.conf)
   - quBSD symlinks these files during appjail start, replacing rootjail clones 
   - Directory/filename in rw, must map exactly the same as the file it replaces
   - rw nullfs mounts on the appjail's root. For example: /jails/{appjail}/rw/ 
   - rw/usr/local/etc/wireguard has a couple items you might find useful 
   - rw/etc/pf.conf is tailored for multiple clients to connect through gateway
       Might require ports/services adjustments depending on your usecase
       Be careful about deleteing certain variables, required during exec.created 
	  If uncertain, just leave the variable with blank "" quotations

Default nullfs mount is already in the fstab, but if you wish to change them:
   - Edit rw/etc/fstab, to change mounts at appjail creation
