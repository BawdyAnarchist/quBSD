The proliferation of bad philosophy, mediated in no small part by the priest class 
known today as lawyers, judges, politicians, et al; has necessitated a clarification 
regarding the nature of information in the realm of humanity. As such, scribbles have
been placed in this document titled "LICENSE" (in quotation marks to signify satire).

***************************************************************************************

This repository (like all repositories) is first and foremost, INFORMATION, often 
called SPEECH. It contains logic and arguments, commonly referred to as "code" or
"software". It also contains opinions, observations, and conditional recommendations.   

As is the case with nearly all information/speech released into the general realm 
of humanity; those who encounter it have the inherent Right to copy, modify, 
use, distribute, and sell; without encumberance, obligation, or prohibition.

I/We, release this speech, for the benefit of humanity, into the general realm of 
humanity, the world at large, sometimes referred to as "the public," while making no
claims of encumberance, obligation, prohibition, or pre-condition regarding its usage.

I/We release this information/speech, "AS IS", providing no promises, or warranties, 
or assurances regarding: Reliability, Accuracy, Suitability, or Non-Infringement.

Excepting extreme circumstances ... When information flies free into the world at large, 
the originator loses any right to prohibit its usage, or to impose fictional claims like 
so-called licenses, copyrights, or patents, absent some clear and valid contract.

So do whatever the fuck you want with it. Do your own evaluation, use at your own risk. 
You are 100% reponsible for your own use of information contained in this repository. 

These things would be true regardless of whatever fictions, pre-conditions, claims,
encumbrances, or demands I might scribble in some farcical speech called "LICENSE"
