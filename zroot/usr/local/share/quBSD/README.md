After install, start with 1_TUTORIAL  -  It walks you through the basic commands, without getting too deep. 

Definitely take a look at 2_Network_Graph as well, it has a large diagram that will elucidate the connection mappings between jails and the nicvm. 

Beware of the manual install. It will get you in the general direction, but it's not anywhere near a straight copy/paste level of accuracy.
