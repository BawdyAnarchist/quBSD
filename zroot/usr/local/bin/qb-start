### NOTES ###

# Attempting to start multiple jails in parallel comes with many problems.
	# Gateway dependencies cause multiple attempted starts of that gateway, locking the system
	# auto IP assignments can be overlapping unless managed ahead of time (before jail starts)
	# Epair confusion when gateway and client are started simultaneously. 

# This script resolves gateway dependencies and networking parameters. 
# It starts jails in serial when necessary, and in parallel where possible.
