                       An outline of quBSD future development 


MAJOR UPGRADES

	Host as Unprivileged user
		- All jails will have an epair to an offline *Control Jail*
		- Unprivileged user on host will pass jails SSH commands via Control Jail
		- Control jail pf will block all, except port 22 between host and jails

	ZFS Encrypted Jails

	Tor and I2P Jails

	USBVM
		- Make the usbvm disposable/ephemeral, as a malware countermeasure 
		- Auto-install various useful mounting stuff for common devices
		- Create a proper unprivileged user with devd.conf and automounts
		- Auto remove password from usbvm


BEST PRACTICES / CLEANUP

	Make it so that zusr isn't required to be a separate zpool dataset

	PCI Passthrough  
		- Bus addresses should be a config spec, not handjammed into the scripts
	
	Maybe MTU should be available as a config option
		- Perhaps a general expansion with a quBSD.conf for other options. 
	
	qb-usbvm
		When xterm is closed with ssh connection, the tap1 connect between jail 
		and usbvm should be severed. Need a "trap" command


MINOR UPGRADES

	qb-mvpn
		- Mullvad VPN: Query and parse mullvad server json; apply to VPN

	qb-cam/mic
		- webcam and mic get brought up with script

	qb-update
		- Update rootjails, create snapshots 

	Config file that maps workspaces to GUI apps; script to launch apps startx

	Crons
		- Popup warning if zpool errors are discovered
		- Popup warning if host has been network connected for too long
